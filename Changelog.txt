2020-03-06: Improved the saving of a level value for a bargraph.

2020-03-04: Fixed the drawing of chameleon images. Now the alpha value for
            the 2nd color is calculatet correct.

2020-02-24: Fixed status button enable/disable. If a button is disabled, it
            can't send anything anymore.
            At the moment a button is set to "disable", it is set to state 0.

2019-12-30: Added some code to remove the status bar on android devices.
            Added some code to avoid that the daemon can be started more than
            one time.
            Added dynamic viewport setting on startup.

2019-12-08: Adjusted the code so that it compiles even with GNU C++ compiler
            version less than 9.0. Now the compiler must support C++17
            standard, even if the filesystem methods are experimental.
